      <h2>What is a Passion Project?</h2>
      <p>A passion project is a self-directed undertaking that aligns with your personal interests, values, and career aspirations. Unlike assigned schoolwork, these projects stem from genuine curiosity and demonstrate initiative to college admissions officers.</p>
      
      <h3>Why Passion Projects Matter</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>College Applications:</strong> They differentiate you from other applicants with similar GPAs and test scores</li>
        <li><strong>Skill Development:</strong> Build tangible skills relevant to potential majors</li>
        <li><strong>Self-Discovery:</strong> Test career interests before committing to a major</li>
        <li><strong>Portfolio Building:</strong> Create concrete examples of your abilities for interviews</li>
        <li><strong>Networking:</strong> Connect with professionals and mentors in your field of interest</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Examples by Interest Area</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>STEM:</strong> Coding an app, building a robot, conducting environmental research</li>
        <li><strong>Humanities:</strong> Starting a literary magazine, producing a documentary, creating a historical exhibit</li>
        <li><strong>Business:</strong> Starting a small business, developing a marketing campaign for a local company</li>
        <li><strong>Arts:</strong> Creating a portfolio, producing a show, teaching workshops to younger students</li>
        <li><strong>Community Service:</strong> Organizing drives or fundraisers, starting a tutoring program, addressing a local issue</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Purpose Statement Framework</h2>
      <p>A strong purpose statement is the foundation of any successful project. Define these four elements clearly:</p>
      
      <div class="formula-box">
        <p><strong>Project Name + Target Audience + Tangible Outcome + Emotional Goal = Clear Purpose</strong></p>
      </div>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Event/Project Name:</strong> What is your project called? Make it concise yet descriptive enough to convey the essence of your work.</li>
        <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Who specifically will benefit from or engage with your work? Be as precise as possible (e.g., "high school students interested in computer science" rather than just "students").</li>
        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> What tangible result will your project produce? This should be concrete and measurable (e.g., "a fully functional mobile app with 3 core features" or "a 30-page research report with original data").</li>
        <li><strong>Emotional Goal:</strong> What feeling or impact do you want to create? Consider how you want your audience to feel or be transformed (e.g., "empowered to make sustainable choices" or "connected to local history").</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Sample Purpose Statements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Weak:</strong> "A website about climate change."</li>
        <li><strong>Strong:</strong> "Climate Action Hub is an interactive resource for high school students that provides actionable climate solutions and data visualizations, designed to transform anxiety about environmental issues into empowerment through specific actions."</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Weak:</strong> "A tutoring project."</li>
        <li><strong>Strong:</strong> "MathMentors connects struggling middle school students with high school math tutors through weekly sessions and custom learning materials, aiming to build confidence and improve performance by at least one letter grade."</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>SMART Goals</h2>
      <p>SMART goals transform vague intentions into concrete action plans. Here's how to craft them effectively:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Specific:</strong> Define exactly what you want to achieve with precise details.
          <ul>
            <li>❌ "Create a good website"</li>
            <li>✅ "Build a 5-page website with information about local renewable energy options, including an interactive calculator for home energy savings"</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Measurable:</strong> Include concrete metrics to track your progress.
          <ul>
            <li>❌ "Interview some professionals"</li>
            <li>✅ "Conduct and transcribe 8 interviews with healthcare professionals from different specialties, each lasting at least 30 minutes"</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Attainable:</strong> Ensure your goal is realistic given your resources and constraints.
          <ul>
            <li>❌ "Create a full feature-length film with professional actors"</li>
            <li>✅ "Produce a 10-minute documentary using interviews from local community members and basic editing software"</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Relevant:</strong> Align with your personal values, interests, and future aspirations.
          <ul>
            <li>❌ "Start a robotics project because it looks good on applications" (if you don't enjoy robotics)</li>
            <li>✅ "Create a digital art portfolio that showcases my interest in animation while developing skills for my intended design major"</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="formula-box">
        <p><strong>SMART Goal Formula:</strong> I will [specific action] measured by [criteria] by [deadline] because [relevance].</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> "I will create a 10-episode podcast about first-generation college experiences measured by completing all interviews, editing, and publishing episodes to at least two platforms by December 1st because it connects my interest in journalism with my experience as a first-generation student."</p>

      <h2>Project Management Tools</h2>
      <p>Use these professional-grade tools to manage your project efficiently:</p>
      
      <h3>Scope Definition Document</h3>
      <p>A clear boundary for your project that prevents "scope creep" and maintains focus.</p>
      <div class="formula-box">
        <p><strong>In Scope:</strong> Specifically list what IS included in your project</p>
        <p><strong>Out of Scope:</strong> Clearly state what is NOT included in your project</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
        In Scope: Creating a website with plant care information, developing 20 plant profile pages, including a watering schedule calculator<br>
        Out of Scope: Selling plants, creating a mobile app version, offering personalized plant consultations</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Risk Assessment Matrix</h3>
      <p>Identify potential issues before they arise and develop mitigation strategies:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Identify risks (e.g., time constraints, technical challenges, resource limitations)</li>
        <li>Rate each risk on likelihood (1-5) and impact (1-5)</li>
        <li>Calculate risk score by multiplying likelihood × impact</li>
        <li>Develop controls to reduce either likelihood or impact</li>
        <li>Reassess residual risk after controls are implemented</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Gap Analysis</h3>
      <p>Regularly assess where you are versus where you want to be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Current State:</strong> Honestly assess what you've accomplished so far</li>
        <li><strong>Desired State:</strong> Clearly define what successful completion looks like</li>
        <li><strong>Gap:</strong> Identify the specific differences between current and desired states</li>
        <li><strong>Action Plan:</strong> Create specific steps to close the gap</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Task Tracking Table</h3>
      <p>A comprehensive way to organize all project activities:</p>
      <table border="1" style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin-top: 15px;">
